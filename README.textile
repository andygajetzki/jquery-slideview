h2. Responsive, JSON loading carousel for jQuery


h3. Why?

There are a lot of jQuery carousels out there. A lot of them were designed before responsive design, tablets, smartphones, CSS3 and HTML5. A lot of the good ones have become payware.

*jquery.slideview* loads slides via JSON, so it's easy to serve larger or smaller sets of images based on the type of device you are targeting. 

Slideview features:

* Responsive
* JSON loading
* Flexible templating
* Animation uses CSS3 transitions for performance and tablet/mobile friendliness
* Fully keyboard accessible


h3. Basic usage

<pre><code>
var json = [
	{
		"title": { "value" : "Skyscrapers" },
		"image": {
			"value" : "assets/images/skyscrapers.jpg",
			"attr" : "src"
			}
	}, {
		"title": { "value" : "Coney island" },
		"image": {
			"value" : "assets/images/wonderwheel.jpg",
			"attr" : "src"
			}
	}
];

var carousel = new $.slideview({
	data: json,
	container: '#my-carousel',
	loop: true
});

carousel.load();
</code></pre>

See demo page for working example and templating docs.
